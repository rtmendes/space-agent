# AGENTS

## Purpose

`_core/admin/` owns the firmware-backed admin area.

It mounts into `/admin`, keeps admin UI assets on `L0`, provides the split admin-shell layout, and owns the current admin panels and admin-specific skill-loading runtime.

Documentation is top priority for this module. After any change under `_core/admin/`, update this file, any affected deeper admin docs, and any affected parent docs in the same session.

## Documentation Hierarchy

`_core/admin/AGENTS.md` owns the admin-wide shell, tabs, shared admin runtime, and the map of deeper admin surfaces.

Current deeper admin docs:

- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/admin/views/agent/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/admin/views/files/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/admin/views/modules/AGENTS.md`

Update rules:

- update the nearest view doc when that view's files, API usage, state model, or CSS contract changes
- update this file when the admin shell, tabs, shared admin runtime, skill loading, or view ownership map changes
- add new deeper docs only for sub-areas with independent runtime, UI, or API contracts

## How To Document Admin Child Docs

Admin view docs should follow one consistent shape:

- `Purpose`
- `Ownership`
- `Runtime And API Contract` or equivalent concrete contract sections
- `UI And State Contract`
- `Development Guidance`

Required coverage for an admin view:

- which HTML, JS, store, CSS, and asset files make up the view
- which admin or shared APIs it calls and what app paths or backend endpoints it reads or mutates
- which state is transient, persisted in session or local storage, or derived from server responses
- which shell hooks, tabs, iframes, dialogs, or quick actions connect it to the broader admin surface
- which styling is local versus inherited from `_core/visual`, `_core/framework`, or admin shell assets

This file keeps shell-wide behavior and skill loading. Child view docs own the concrete UI, store, and API contracts of each view.

## Ownership

This module owns:

- `ext/html/page/admin/body/start/admin-shell.html`: thin adapter that mounts the admin shell into `server/pages/admin.html`
- `views/shell/`: split shell layout, tab state, and iframe orchestration
- `views/dashboard/`: dashboard and launch surface inside the admin pane
- `views/agent/`: admin-side agent surface
- `views/files/`: firmware-backed file browser
- `views/modules/`: firmware-backed modules panel
- `skills/`: top-level admin skill folders, each with `SKILL.md`
- `res/`: admin-local visual assets

Inactive area:

- `views/documentation/` exists on disk but is not currently mounted by the admin shell; do not document it as an active admin surface until the shell actually wires it in

## Shell Contract

The admin module is mounted only through the page-specific `page/admin/body/start` anchor.

Current shell responsibilities:

- `views/shell/shell.html` owns the split two-pane layout
- `views/shell/shell.js` owns split sizing, drag-resize behavior, orientation-dependent layout, `?url=` startup handling, and leave-admin navigation back into the current iframe URL
- `views/shell/page.js` owns admin tabs, quick actions, tab keyboard behavior, cached `space.api.userSelfInfo()` state, and `_admin` membership checks derived from `groups`
- the active admin tab is remembered in `sessionStorage`
- iframe-local routed navigation such as the onscreen menu Dashboard action should keep the right-hand pane inside the iframe unless the action explicitly leaves `/admin`

`/admin` runs with `maxLayer=0`, so all module and extension fetches for the admin UI stay firmware-backed even though app-file APIs still work across normal readable or writable layers.

## Admin Sub-Areas

High-level ownership:

- `views/dashboard/` is the lightweight dashboard and launch surface
- `views/agent/` is the admin-side chat or execution surface and owns `space.admin.loadSkill(...)`
- `views/files/` is the firmware-backed file browser for app-rooted paths
- `views/modules/` is the firmware-backed module list and removal surface

## Skills Contract

Admin skills live under `skills/*/SKILL.md`.

Current rules:

- `views/agent/skills.js` discovers top-level skill folders by listing `L0/_all/mod/_core/admin/skills/`
- the admin agent prompt receives a compact catalog of those top-level skills
- the actual skill content is loaded on demand through `space.admin.loadSkill(name)`
- keep skill folders stable and top-level if they should appear in the catalog

## Development Guidance

- keep admin UI logic inside this module; do not spread admin-only behavior into unrelated modules
- keep admin assets local under `admin/res/` instead of borrowing from unrelated feature modules
- keep the admin shell firmware-backed; do not introduce writable-layer dependencies for the admin UI contract itself
- if you add tabs, change the shell seam, or change how skills are discovered, update this file and `/app/AGENTS.md`
