name: Backend Reference
description: Read-only reference for the backend contracts that the frontend depends on, including routing, APIs, auth, layers, and module resolution.
---

Use this skill when frontend work depends on understanding backend behavior. This skill is read-only context, not authorization to change backend files.

## Hard Boundary

- Do not edit `server/`, `commands/`, or `packaging/` from this skill set.
- If the task truly requires backend changes, stop and ask instead of treating this skill as permission.
- Backend changes are non-standard in this project. Only ask for them when frontend-only work cannot safely enforce security, integrity, cross-user isolation, or runtime stability.
- When you ask, explain why the frontend solution would be insufficient and describe the narrow backend change required.

## Page And Request Flow

Current request order is:

1. API preflight handling
2. `/api/proxy`
3. `/api/<endpoint>`
4. `/mod/...`
5. `/~/...` and `/L0/...`, `/L1/...`, `/L2/...`
6. page shells and page actions

The browser app mounts through page shells in `server/pages/`. `/login` is public. `/` and `/admin` require authentication.

## API Families

Important frontend-facing endpoint families are:

- app files: `file_list`, `file_paths`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_delete`, `file_copy`, `file_move`, `file_info`, `folder_download`
- modules: `module_list`, `module_info`, `module_install`, `module_remove`
- runtime and identity: `extensions_load`, `password_generate`, `user_self_info`

These endpoints are thin wrappers over shared helpers in `server/lib/customware/` and `server/lib/auth/`.

`folder_download` supports `HEAD` for permission-only validation and `GET` or `POST` for the streamed ZIP attachment. It creates the archive in `server/tmp/` only for the actual download response, after the shared file-access layer approves the requested folder path.

`user_self_info` is the frontend-facing identity snapshot. Frontend callers derive writable app roots from `username`, `managedGroups`, and `_admin` membership in `groups` without authorizing backend edits.

## Module And Extension Resolution

- `/mod/...` resolution goes through the layered customware model.
- `maxLayer` constrains module and extension resolution and defaults to `2`.
- `/admin` effectively clamps module and extension resolution to `L0`.
- Frontend HTML extensions resolve through `ext/html/...`.
- Frontend JS hooks resolve through `ext/js/...`.
- Frontend modules may also enumerate other extension-owned assets such as `ext/pages/*.yaml` through `extensions_load` when they need the same permission-aware layered override behavior.

## Auth And User Storage

- The server issues the `space_session` cookie and validates it by hashing it with a backend-held secret.
- User metadata lives at `L2/<username>/user.yaml`.
- `L2/<username>/meta/password.json` stores a server-sealed SCRAM verifier envelope, not a self-sufficient plaintext verifier.
- `L2/<username>/meta/logins.json` stores backend-keyed session verifiers plus signed session metadata.
- User-owned modules live under `L2/<username>/mod/`.
- Backend auth keys come from shared environment injection through `SPACE_AUTH_PASSWORD_SEAL_KEY` and `SPACE_AUTH_SESSION_HMAC_KEY` for multi-instance deployments, or from the local fallback `server/data/auth_keys.json` during single-instance development.

## Why Frontend Developers Need This

- to understand why a frontend file API call succeeds or fails
- to understand where module and extension inheritance comes from
- to understand why admin UI is firmware-clamped while normal app routing is layered
- to understand the user and group storage model without editing backend logic
- to identify the small set of cases where backend ownership is mandatory instead of merely convenient

## Mandatory Doc Follow-Up

- If backend contracts that the frontend depends on change, update the mirrored backend docs and the `development` skill subtree in the same session, even though this skill remains read-only guidance.
