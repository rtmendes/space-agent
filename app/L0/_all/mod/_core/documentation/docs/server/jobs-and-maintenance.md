# Jobs And Maintenance

This doc covers the primary-owned server job runner and the current guest-maintenance jobs.

## Primary Sources

- `server/AGENTS.md`
- `server/runtime/AGENTS.md`
- `server/jobs/AGENTS.md`
- `server/jobs/job_runner.js`
- `server/jobs/guest_cleanup_inactive.js`
- `server/jobs/guest_cleanup_oversized.js`
- `server/lib/auth/user_manage.js`

## Ownership And Discovery

The server now has a dedicated `server/jobs/` subtree for periodic backend-owned maintenance work.

Current rules:

- job files are discovered deterministically from `server/jobs/*.js`
- infrastructure files in that same folder own the shared base class, registry, scheduler, and helper logic
- each job module exports a default class extending `JobBase`
- the job id comes from the filename, not from a sidecar metadata file
- jobs may optionally implement `isEnabled(context)` when runtime-config gating should prevent scheduling entirely

This keeps the subsystem small and makes one folder the whole source of truth.

## Scheduling Model

Jobs currently use interval schedules, not cron syntax.

Each job class returns a small schedule object from `getSchedule()`:

- `everyMs`: required repeat interval
- `initialDelayMs`: optional first-run delay; defaults to one full interval
- `lockTtlMs`: optional named-lock TTL used by the runner

Important behavior:

- jobs run only on the authoritative runtime owner: the single server process when `WORKERS=1`, or the clustered primary when `WORKERS>1`
- workers never execute jobs
- disabled jobs are not scheduled at all; the runner checks `isEnabled(context)` before creating timers and again before each run
- the runner acquires a named lock per job id through the primary-owned unified state system before each run
- jobs do not overlap
- the next due time is based on the current run's start time plus `everyMs`, so long runs do not trigger overlap or catch-up bursts

## Mutation Contract

Jobs should stay orchestration-only.

When a job needs to change app files:

- it should call the shared helper that owns the behavior, such as `server/lib/auth/user_manage.js`
- it should run that helper through the runner's tracked-mutation wrapper
- the changed logical app paths are then committed through the normal watchdog mutation path so file, user, and session indexes refresh correctly in both single-process and clustered runtime
- that mutation commit flow is the normal index-refresh path; jobs should not assume a frequent full-tree reconcile will pick their writes up later

Jobs should not invent their own filesystem refresh loop, direct worker broadcast, or lockfile protocol, and they should not rely on the watchdog's rare backstop reconcile for routine freshness.

## Current Guest Jobs

Guest identity remains prefix-based through randomized `guest_...` usernames.

Both guest-maintenance jobs are disabled entirely when guest-account creation is disabled by runtime config.

`guest_cleanup_inactive`:

- runs once per hour
- inspects loaded watchdog file-index entries under each guest `L2/<username>/` root; unloaded stale guests are intentionally not discovered by a startup or reconcile scan
- uses the most recent tracked file `mtimeMs`, falling back to any tracked entry under the root when needed
- deletes a guest when no tracked change has happened in the last 72 hours

`guest_cleanup_oversized`:

- runs every 5 minutes
- inspects the same loaded guest `L2/<username>` file-index slice
- counts tracked files and sums tracked file bytes
- deletes a guest when either threshold is exceeded: more than 1000 tracked files, or more than 1,000,000,000 total tracked bytes

Both jobs intentionally use the existing file index instead of rescanning the filesystem ad hoc.
