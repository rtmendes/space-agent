# Module And Runtime APIs

This doc covers the non-file API families that matter most to the browser agent.

## Primary Sources

- `server/api/AGENTS.md`
- `server/lib/customware/module_manage.js`
- `server/lib/auth/service.js`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/js/api-client.js`

## Public Auth And Health Endpoints

Current public endpoints:

- `health`
- `guest_create`
- `login_challenge`
- `login`
- `login_check`

Important notes:

- these are the public auth and health endpoints; hosted-share endpoints are the other anonymous family
- password login flows through the shared auth challenge/proof service when `LOGIN_ALLOWED=true`, while guest-background flows may still use the guest-specific subset when `LOGIN_ALLOWED=false`
- `login_challenge` also reports `userCrypto` bootstrap state; legacy accounts with no `meta/user_crypto.json` receive a one-time provisioning share so the browser can generate the missing wrapped record before final login, while accounts whose wrapped record no longer has any recoverable server share are reported as `invalidated`
- `login` completes both the auth session and the `userCrypto` bootstrap: it may persist a missing `user_crypto.json` record before issuing the cookie, and successful responses return a backend `sessionId` plus the `userCrypto` payload needed to unlock the current browser session
- `guest_create` creates a guest `L2` user whenever runtime config allows guest accounts, even when `LOGIN_ALLOWED=false`
- `login_check` stays available even when `LOGIN_ALLOWED=false` for public session checks, while guest-bootstrap and hosted-share flows may still complete the same background `login_challenge` plus `login` path without showing the `/login` form
- in clustered runtime, login challenges are coordinated through the primary-only `login_challenge` area of the unified state system while workers validate cookies from auth-only user/session shards and write `logins.json`

## Hosted Share And Import Endpoints

Current share endpoints:

- `cloud_share_create`
- `cloud_share_info`
- `cloud_share_download`
- `cloud_share_clone`
- `space_import`

Important behaviors:

- hosted share uploads are anonymous so one Space Agent runtime can upload to a separate hosted receiver
- `cloud_share_create` stores the raw ZIP under `CUSTOMWARE_PATH/share/spaces/<token>.zip` with matching JSON metadata, rejects payloads over `2 MB`, and intentionally does not unpack or deeply validate the archive at upload time
- `cloud_share_create` is enabled only when `CLOUD_SHARE_ALLOWED=true`, guest users are enabled, and the receiver has a configured `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`
- stored share metadata includes the token, create time, last-used time, payload size, and optional browser-side password-encryption parameters
- `cloud_share_info` returns enough metadata for the public share shell to decide whether it must ask for a password before clone
- `cloud_share_download` returns the stored ZIP bytes so the browser can decrypt password-protected shares before clone
- `cloud_share_clone` validates the clear ZIP in a unique `server/tmp/` extraction directory, creates a fresh guest account, installs the result as `imported-N`, updates the share `lastUsedAt`, and returns the guest credentials plus redirect URL that the public share shell uses to finish the normal background login flow
- authenticated `space_import` uses the same archive-validation path for local ZIP imports from the spaces modal, replacing the current space only when the caller explicitly chooses overwrite; otherwise the imported space is renamed to the next `imported-N` destination

## Module Endpoints
Current module endpoints:

- `module_list`
- `module_info`
- `module_install`
- `module_remove`

These delegate to `server/lib/customware/module_manage.js`.

Important behaviors:

- module writes must reuse shared permission rules
- module writes should publish changed logical paths through the shared mutation commit flow so every worker sees the new module state before the response finishes
- request-time module list and info reads consume shared-state file-index shards, usually only the readable `L1` roots plus the caller's demand-loaded `L2`, instead of scanning the full app index
- when `USER_FOLDER_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES` is positive, new L2 module installs are cloned into a system temp directory, measured, and quota-checked before they are moved into `L2/<user>/mod/...`
- module list surfaces distinguish areas such as `l1`, `l2_self`, `l2_user`, and `l2_users`
- cross-user or aggregated user-layer module listings are admin-only
- follow-up requests that depend on the new module state rely on `Space-State-Version` fencing rather than a cluster-wide worker acknowledgement barrier

## Runtime And Identity Endpoints

Important runtime endpoints:

- `extensions_load`
- `debug_path_index`
- `password_generate`
- `password_change`
- `user_crypto_bootstrap`
- `user_crypto_session_key`
- `user_self_info`

`extensions_load`:

- resolves module-owned `ext/...` files through the layered override system
- supports grouped extension lookups
- is the shared backend for frontend extension loading
- ensures the caller's full L2 file-index shard when max layer allows user customware, then reads the shared-state shards needed for the caller's visible module owners instead of scanning the full watchdog path index
- receives grouped lookup batches from the frontend; the batching policy itself lives in the frontend loader, not in the endpoint contract
- keeps `maxLayer` at the call level and grouped `patterns` inside ordered request entries, then returns grouped results in that same order with the matching normalized `patterns` plus resolved `extensions`
- first-party HTML anchors and JS hooks use it for `ext/html/...` and `ext/js/...`
- first-party metadata workflows that only need readable logical file paths, such as dashboard panel manifests, should prefer `file_paths` plus `file_read` instead of routing through `extensions_load`

`debug_path_index`:

- is authenticated and intended for clustered-runtime verification
- ensures the caller's full L2 shard, then returns filtered local `path_index` compatibility entries, the local loaded-index size, and a stable hash of the returned entry set
- accepts exact `path` or `paths` plus directory `prefix` or `prefixes`
- is meant for tests and temporary diagnostics, not for general frontend workflows

`user_self_info`:

- is the canonical frontend identity snapshot
- returns `{ username, fullName, groups, managedGroups, sessionId, userCryptoKeyId, userCryptoState }`
- should be used by browser code to infer writable roots instead of relying on a broader serialized permission blob
- also gives `_core/user_crypto` the backend `sessionId` and current key state it needs to restore or invalidate session-scoped browser decryption state

`password_generate`:

- is authenticated
- returns a backend-sealed password payload
- should stay narrow and backend-owned

`password_change`:

- is authenticated and applies only to the current user
- validates the current password through the auth service before generating the replacement sealed verifier
- rewrites `meta/password.json`, rewraps `meta/user_crypto.json` when the current account has ready browser crypto, clears stored sessions, and clears the current browser auth cookie so the frontend can return to `/login`

`user_crypto_bootstrap`:

- is an authenticated recovery endpoint for the current user's browser session
- returns the current `userCrypto` state
- when the state is `missing`, it can return a provisioning share for that authenticated session and later accept the wrapped record generated in the browser
- exists so the first authenticated app load can self-heal a missing `userCrypto` record instead of requiring a second login

`user_crypto_session_key`:

- is an authenticated restore endpoint for the current browser session
- returns the session-derived wrapping key created by hashing the live backend `sessionId` with the server-held session secret
- lets `_core/user_crypto` restore the unlocked browser key from the encrypted `localStorage` blob without storing that wrapping key at rest
- does not persist per-session restore grants or any backend copy of the user master key

## Health Helper

The frontend API client exposes `space.api.health()` for the health endpoint.

It returns a small status shape rather than a broad runtime dump.
