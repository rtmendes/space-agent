# Modules And Extensions

This doc covers how browser code is delivered and composed.

## Primary Sources

- `app/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/login_hooks/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/promptinclude/AGENTS.md`
- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/router/AGENTS.md`
- `server/lib/customware/AGENTS.md`
- `server/api/AGENTS.md`

## Module Paths

Browser modules are namespaced as:

```txt
mod/<author>/<repo>/...
```

Examples:

- `/mod/_core/agent/view.html`
- `/mod/_core/framework/js/initFw.js`
- `/mod/_core/router/view.html`
- `/mod/_core/documentation/documentation.js`
- `/mod/_core/huggingface/view.html`
- `/mod/_core/webllm/view.html`

The backend resolves those requests through layered customware inheritance, so the same `/mod/...` URL may be backed by `L0`, `L1`, or `L2`.

## Router Path Resolution

The authenticated router is hash-based.

Important route rules:

- `#/agent` -> `/mod/_core/agent/view.html`
- `#/dashboard` -> `/mod/_core/dashboard/view.html`
- `#/huggingface` -> `/mod/_core/huggingface/view.html`
- `#/webllm` -> `/mod/_core/webllm/view.html`
- `#/author/repo/path` -> `/mod/author/repo/path/view.html`
- if the last route segment already ends in `.html`, the router resolves directly to that file under `/mod/...`

The main router helper surface is published on `space.router` and Alpine `$router`.

## HTML Extension Anchors

HTML extension seams use:

```html
<x-extension id="some/path"></x-extension>
```

Resolution rules:

- the caller names only the seam
- matching files live under `mod/<author>/<repo>/ext/html/some/path/*.html`
- extension files should stay thin and normally mount the real component or view

Important shared router seams include:

- `_core/router/shell_start`
- `_core/router/shell_end`
- `page/router/route/start`
- `page/router/route/end`
- `page/router/overlay/start`
- `page/router/overlay/end`

Current first-party shell extension example:

- `_core/onscreen_menu` mounts into `_core/router/shell_start` and owns the top-right routed page menu, which lists Dashboard then Agent then Admin plus auth-dependent Logout or Leave actions

## JavaScript Extension Hooks

Behavior seams use `space.extend(import.meta, async function name() {})`.

Rules:

- the wrapped function becomes async
- hooks resolve under `mod/<author>/<repo>/ext/js/<extension-point>/*.js` or `*.mjs`
- wrapped functions expose `/start` and `/end` hook points
- framework-backed page boot exposes `_core/framework/initializer.js/initialize`; its `/end` hook is the normal place for once-per-page integrations such as analytics bootstrap or `document.head` tag setup
- feature-specific prompt or execution behavior for the onscreen agent should be supplied from the owning module through `_core/onscreen_agent/...` extension seams, not hardcoded into `_core/onscreen_agent`
- headless helper modules are valid first-party modules too: `_core/promptinclude` has no route or UI, but it extends `_core/onscreen_agent/llm.js/buildOnscreenAgentSystemPromptSections` and `_core/onscreen_agent/llm.js/buildOnscreenAgentTransientSections` to auto-inject readable `**/*.system.include.md` files into the overlay system prompt and readable `**/*.transient.include.md` files into the overlay transient context
- `_core/login_hooks` is another headless helper module: it extends `_core/framework/initializer.js/initialize/end`, checks for the client-owned `~/meta/login_hooks.json` marker, dispatches `_core/login_hooks/first_login` once when that marker is absent, and dispatches `_core/login_hooks/any_login` when the authenticated shell was reached directly from `/login`

Uncached HTML `<x-extension>` lookups are grouped before they hit `/api/extensions_load`:

- by default the frontend flushes the lookup queue on the next animation frame
- frontend constant `HTML_EXTENSIONS_LOAD_BATCH_WAIT_MS` in `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/js/extensions.js` adds an extra wait window in milliseconds before that frame-aligned flush
- when a frame does not arrive, the frontend falls back to a short timeout so the queue still drains

JS hook lookups do not use that frame wait window. Hook callers await them directly, so the frontend requests JS extension paths immediately instead of delaying them for batching.

## Extension Metadata Manifests

Not every extension-resolved file is an HTML adapter or JS hook.

Modules may also store lightweight metadata manifests under other `ext/` folders when that data should follow the same readable-layer permissions and same-path override rules as HTML and JS extensions.

Current first-party example:

- `_core/pages` discovers dashboard page manifests from `mod/<author>/<repo>/ext/pages/*.yaml` through `extensions_load`
- `_core/agent` publishes `ext/pages/agent.yaml` so the dashboard can launch the routed agent settings page without hardcoding it into dashboard or router; that route stays self-contained inside the module, keeps the astronaut info card, exposes only the external repo CTA, and edits the raw `~/conf/personality.system.include.md` prompt-include file
- each page manifest defines display metadata such as `name`, `path`, optional `description`, optional `icon`, and optional `color`
- page `path` values may be shorthand route paths such as `webllm`, prefixed hash paths such as `#/webllm`, or direct `/mod/...` HTML paths such as `/mod/_core/webllm/view.html`
- page manifests are module assets, not writable app-file state

## `<x-component>`

The component loader accepts both full HTML documents and fragments.

Behavior:

- styles and stylesheets are appended to the mount target
- module scripts are loaded via dynamic `import()`
- nested `<x-component>` tags are loaded recursively
- wrapper attributes are exposed to descendants through `xAttrs($el)`

The normal ownership split is:

- component HTML owns structure and Alpine bindings
- store modules own state and async work
- helper modules own dense transforms or protocol logic

## Route-Local Workers

Heavy browser-only runtimes do not have to become global framework dependencies.

Current first-party example:

- `_core/huggingface` keeps its worker, vendored local import shim, and the Transformers.js browser runtime contract inside one module-local singleton manager that the routed page and admin modal can both import inside the same browser context
- `_core/webllm` keeps the vendored WebLLM browser build and its dedicated worker inside the module
- routed pages should keep page-local UI state in their own stores, but reusable browser-runtime ownership can sit in a module-local manager when multiple surfaces need one live state source
- this is the preferred pattern for experimental routed test surfaces that need a large browser runtime but do not yet justify promotion into `_core/framework`

## Shared Visual Primitives

Reusable modal structure lives under `_core/visual`, not inside each feature.

Important dialog rules:

- `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/visual/forms/dialog.css` owns the shared modal shell classes for fixed header/footer chrome
- use `dialog-card-shell` plus `dialog-scroll-body` or `dialog-scroll-frame` when a modal has long content and persistent footer actions
- use `dialog-actions-split` and related dialog action helpers for compact split footers instead of feature-local inline flex layout
- do not put overflow on the full dialog card when the footer must stay reachable; scroll only the inner body or framed content region

## Override Rules

Module and extension resolution follow the same layered model:

- exact same override keys replace lower-ranked entries
- different filenames under the same extension point compose together
- `maxLayer` limits module and extension lookup but not ordinary app-file APIs

This is why modules such as `documentation` and `skillset` can expose ordinary JS helpers that skills import through stable `/mod/...` URLs.
