# Onscreen Agent Runtime

This doc covers the floating routed overlay agent as a frontend runtime surface.

## Primary Sources

## What The Module Owns

`_core/onscreen_agent/` owns:

- the routed overlay adapter in the router overlay seam
- the floating shell UI and compact bubble UI
- chat history and overlay config persistence
- prompt assembly and prompt history previews
- attachment handling
- the execution loop and streamed execution cards
- onscreen skill discovery and `space.skills.load(...)`

## Persistence

Current persisted files:

- config: `~/conf/onscreen-agent.yaml`
- history: `~/hist/onscreen-agent.json`

Important config fields:

- provider endpoint and model params
- `max_tokens`
- optional `custom_system_prompt`
- `agent_x`, `agent_y`
- optional `hidden_edge`
- optional `history_height`
- `display_mode`

Current defaults:

- endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
- model: `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`
- params: `temperature: 0.2`
- max tokens: `64000`
- display mode: `compact`

## Runtime Surface

The overlay publishes `space.onscreenAgent`.

That namespace is the stable external entry point for:

- showing or hiding the overlay, including revealing a persisted edge-hidden peeking pose before normal use resumes
- triggering prompt submission from outside the module

The active chat surface also publishes the current prompt/history snapshot on `space.chat`.

## UI Ownership

Key files:

- `panel.html`: overlay DOM shell
- `onscreen-agent.css`: shell, floating window, compact bubble, and overlay-local styling
- `response-markdown.css`: markdown presentation for assistant responses
- `view.js`: thread rendering wiring
- `store.js`: display mode, drag, edge-hide peeking, resize, send loop, queued follow-ups, and scroll behavior

The routed overlay anchors in `_core/router` are the supported place for floating routed UI. The overlay should not be hardwired directly into the router shell.

The settings and prompt-history dialogs reuse the shared `_core/visual/forms/dialog.css` shell layout. Their header and footer rows stay fixed while only the settings body or prompt-history frame scrolls, so the footer actions remain reachable even when the content is long.

Dragging the astronaut past any viewport edge now first hits a dead zone at the in-screen clamp that matches the reveal-threshold distance so corner placement stays practical, then snaps the shell into a hidden peeking pose on that edge after the pointer crosses that extra distance. In that state about 55 percent of the avatar remains in view, the astronaut keeps its normal left or right facing flip while also rotating by edge direction, the chat body collapses away, and a click or drag back past the reveal threshold restores the previous compact or full chat body.

The onboarding hint bubble is now deliberately minimal. Its single 2-second countdown is tied only to overlay mount timing, never to page load: `store.js` starts it during `mount`. Once visible, the hint auto-dismisses after 3 seconds unless a real trusted shell `pointerdown` dismisses it first. The hint is rendered through its own dedicated `panel.html` bubble instead of the generic assistant bubble runtime, so it does not depend on markdown rendering, auto-hide behavior, or assistant-bubble suppression rules. It shows `**Drag** me, **tap** me.` if the shell still has not received any real trusted `pointerdown`, and it is allowed to render even when the overlay restored into an edge-hidden pose.

## Prompt Files

Prompt file ownership is split:

- `prompts/system-prompt.md`: firmware prompt for normal turns
- `prompts/compact-prompt.md`: user-triggered history compaction
- `prompts/compact-prompt-auto.md`: automatic history compaction

The current live firmware prompt was promoted from `tests/agent_llm_performance/prompts/069A_handoff_no_copy.md` on `2026-04-07` after the `070` through `075` sweep confirmed it was still the best overall prompt on the 57-case suite.

The base prompt file is not the only model-facing prompt source. `_core/promptinclude` adds the stable prompt-include instruction section through the prompt-section seam, appends readable `*.system.include.md` files there as additional system-prompt sections, and injects readable `*.transient.include.md` file bodies later through transient context.

Read `agent/prompt-and-execution.md` next for the actual prompt assembly and execution protocol.
