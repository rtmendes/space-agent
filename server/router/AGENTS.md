# AGENTS

## Purpose

`server/router/` owns top-level HTTP request handling for the local server runtime.

It is responsible for request ordering, request context creation, page handling, `/mod/...` serving, direct app-file fetches, proxy routing, CORS handling, body parsing, and shared response helpers.

Documentation is top priority for this subtree. After any change under `server/router/`, update this file and any affected parent or helper docs in the same session.

## Ownership

Current files:

- `router.js`: top-level routing order and API dispatch
- `pages_handler.js`: page-route redirects, auth gating, `/logout`, and `/pages/res/...`
- `mod_handler.js`: `/mod/...` serving through layered module inheritance
- `app_fetch_handler.js`: `/~/...` and `/L0/...`, `/L1/...`, `/L2/...` direct app-file serving
- `request_context.js`: cookie parsing, request user resolution, and AsyncLocalStorage-backed request context
- `request_body.js`: parsed request-body helpers
- `cors.js`: API CORS headers and preflight handling
- `responses.js`: shared JSON, redirect, file, and generic API response writers
- `proxy.js`: outbound fetch proxy transport for `/api/proxy`

## Routing Order

Current request order is fixed:

1. API preflight handling
2. `/api/proxy`
3. `/api/<endpoint>`
4. `/mod/...`
5. `/~/...` and `/L0/...`, `/L1/...`, `/L2/...`
6. page shells and page actions

Rules:

- keep this order explicit and centralized in `router.js`
- do not hide route precedence in scattered conditionals across unrelated files
- all non-public API, module, and app-fetch routes require an authenticated request context before dispatch

## State Version Contract

`router.js` owns the request-level replicated-state fence.

Current behavior:

- every response advertises the worker's current replicated version through `Space-State-Version`
- every response also advertises the handling worker number through `Space-Worker`
- requests may send `Space-State-Version` as the minimum version they require before handling continues, and top-level navigations reuse that same minimum version through the short-lived `space_state_version` cookie that browser helpers mirror from recent responses
- when a worker is behind that requested version, the router waits briefly for local catch-up before dispatch
- if the worker still cannot satisfy the requested version within the bounded wait, the router returns a retryable `503`
- the frontend fetch wrapper is expected to carry the highest seen version on follow-up same-origin requests, while the router clears cookie-sourced state-version handoffs once it has consumed them

## Request Context Contract

`request_context.js` owns request-scoped auth state.

Current behavior:

- cookies are parsed once from the incoming request
- the auth service resolves the current user from the `space_session` cookie or from the runtime single-user override
- request context creation is asynchronous because resolving a multi-user session may need to demand-load that user's auth-only state before the replicated user and session indexes are available on the worker
- the request context carries `ensureUserFileIndex(username)` for routes that need user-owned file listings; auth resolution itself must not force a full L2 shard load
- multi-user session auth hashes the incoming cookie through a backend-held key, matches the resulting verifier against `meta/logins.json`, and rejects unsigned or expired session records
- multi-user `space_session` cookie values include a username hint plus the bearer token; token-only legacy cookies cannot be resolved without scanning all L2 users and should be cleared
- the request context is stored in AsyncLocalStorage for the lifetime of the request
- `ensureAuthenticatedRequestContext(...)` is the shared guard for authenticated routes

## Serving Contracts

Pages:

- `pages_handler.js` is the only owner of page auth gating, pretty-route redirects, `/logout`, `/pages/res/...`, root favicon and manifest aliases, injected frontend runtime-config meta tags, and project-version placeholder injection
- `pages_handler.js` is also the only owner of the public root crawler and LLM discovery aliases for `/robots.txt`, `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml`
- `/login` is public even when `LOGIN_ALLOWED=false`, but the login shell should then show only the public copy and links instead of the password form
- `/share/space/<token>` is a special public multi-segment page route served directly by `pages_handler.js` when guest users are enabled; if guest users are disabled, it should resolve as missing
- `/enter` serves the firmware-backed launcher shell for launcher-eligible sessions: always in `SINGLE_USER_APP=true`, and also for authenticated multi-user requests; unauthenticated multi-user requests are redirected to `/login`
- `pages_handler.js` injects a pre-module page-shell guard into `/` and `/admin` whenever the current request already has launcher access, so a new browser-opened tab or window is redirected to `/enter?next=<current-url>` while reloads in the same tab keep loading normally; the framework may pre-grant that same access marker for its own same-origin `_blank` opens before the guarded page loads
- page shells that declare the `SPACE_PROJECT_VERSION` placeholder receive the resolved project version string from `server/lib/utils/project_version.js`; `/login` and `/enter` use this for the centered public-shell version label
- root requests for `/favicon.ico`, `/favicon-16x16.png`, `/favicon-32x32.png`, `/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/android-chrome-192x192.png`, `/android-chrome-512x512.png`, and `/site.webmanifest` are served from `server/pages/res/` without authentication so page heads can use platform-standard asset URLs
- root requests for `/robots.txt`, `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml` are served from `server/pages/` without authentication so crawlers and LLM tooling can discover the public site summary and indexable entry points
- `/logout` redirects to `/login` after clearing the current auth cookie
- `/` and `/admin` require authentication

Modules:

- `mod_handler.js` resolves `/mod/...` through `server/lib/customware/module_inheritance.js`
- `/mod/...`, page-shell HTML, and `server/pages/res/` asset responses should be emitted with explicit no-store headers so source updates replace stale browser or proxy caches on reload across origins such as `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and deployed hosts
- request-time module serving should consume the replicated shared state interface passed into the router, not reach back into watchdog-specific scanning helpers
- module serving and direct app-file serving must ensure the current user's full L2 file-index shard before resolving user-layer paths
- logical `L1` and `L2` module overrides may come from the configured `CUSTOMWARE_PATH` storage root even though request paths stay `/mod/...`
- `maxLayer` is read from explicit request data, query params, the `X-Space-Max-Layer` request header, or admin-origin fallback through `layer_limit.js`

Direct app-file fetches:

- `app_fetch_handler.js` maps `/~/...` to the authenticated user's `L2/<username>/...`
- `/L0/...`, `/L1/...`, and `/L2/...` are also supported for authenticated direct fetches
- those request paths stay logical even when `CUSTOMWARE_PATH` moves writable `L1` and `L2` storage outside the repo
- app-fetch path decoding must percent-decode each URL path segment before logical app-path normalization so browser-encoded filenames such as spaces, brackets, unicode, `#`, and `?` resolve to their real on-disk names, while encoded path separators such as `%2F` or `%5C` remain invalid instead of becoming filesystem separators
- read permission checks are delegated to `createAppAccessController(...)`
- `.git` metadata paths are blocked even when they live inside a readable writable-layer owner root

Responses:

- `responses.js` owns JSON serialization, redirects, file responses, stream responses, and Web `Response` bridging
- `responses.js.sendFile(...)` must stream file bodies from disk after a stat check instead of buffering the whole file into memory first
- `cors.js` owns the API CORS policy and `OPTIONS` handling
- `router.js` must log every caught API handler failure once, including non-5xx responses, and should prefer an attached `error.cause` when endpoint wrappers preserve the underlying backend exception; 5xx bodies are still redacted to `Internal server error` for the browser

## Development Guidance

- keep routing logic here, not in page or API modules
- keep page and module serving thin and delegate policy decisions to shared helpers
- do not bypass `request_context.js` for auth state
- if routing order, page gating, launcher behavior, or direct app-fetch semantics change, also update the matching docs under `app/L0/_all/mod/_core/documentation/docs/server/`
- if routing order, auth flow, page handling, response contracts, or state-version fencing change, update this file and `/server/AGENTS.md`
